                        <p>St. Joseph, unite my prayers with those of the other members and friends of the apostolate throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>We know, St. Joseph, that Our Lord will refuse you nothing. Please ask God to bless the apostolate and all of its members and friends. Ask Our Lord to help the members of the apostolate to make the best use of the modern means of communications to consecrate families, parishes, and movements in the Truth and to help families understand and imitate the Eucharistic, Marian, and family-centered spirituality of Saint John Paul II.  </p>
                        <p> St. Joseph, we are confident that you will remove all obstacles in the path of the apostolate so that our society may be transformed through a chain reaction which will renew our families, neighborhoods, parishes, schools, country, and the entire world.  </p>
                        <p>Form the apostolate into a useful instrument of the Holy Family, and never let its members lose their holy zeal for souls or fall into the sin of spiritual pride like that of the Pharisees, which is so fatal to the work of God. Use the apostolate as an instrument to bring about the social reign of the Most Holy Family in our age. Amen. </p>
