<b>Apostles' Creed</b><BR>
I believe in God,<BR>
the Father almighty,<BR>
Creator of heaven and earth,<BR>
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<BR>
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<BR>
born of the Virgin Mary,<BR>
suffered under Pontius Pilate,<BR>
was crucified, died and was buried;<BR>
he descended into hell;<BR>
on the third day he rose again from the dead;<BR>
he ascended into heaven,<BR>
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;<BR>
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<BR>
<BR><BR>
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<BR>

the resurrection of the body,<BR>
and life everlasting.

Amen.

<b>Hail, Holy Queen</b><BR>
HAIL, Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us. And after this our exile, show unto us the blessed Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, o Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.
<br><br>
Let us pray. O GOD, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

<b>The Memorare</b><BR>

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
<br><br>
Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.
<br><br>
Amen.
