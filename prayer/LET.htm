<b>Hail, Holy Queen</b><BR>
HAIL, Holy Queen, Mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy towards us. And after this our exile, show unto us the blessed Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, o Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.
<br><br>
Let us pray. O GOD, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

<br><br>
<b>The Memorare</b><BR>

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
<br><br>
Inspired by this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my mother; to thee do I come, before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but in thy mercy hear and answer me.
<br><br>
Amen.

<b>St. Joseph Prayer after the Rosary</b><br><br>

Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Immaculate Virgin, obtain for me and all the members of my family and loved ones, a confident, sinless, generous, and patient heart, and perfect resignation to the Divine Will. Be our guide, father, and model throughout life, that we may merit a death like yours, in the arms of Jesus and Mary.
<br>
Help us, St. Joseph, in our earthly strife, to fulfill our responsibilities and ever to lead a pure and blameless life.
<br>
Heavenly Father, please ask the Holy Spirit, who resides in the innermost recesses of my soul, to help me to call to mind all of my sins and faults. Help me to detach myself from these faults and sins so that I can be a useful instrument in the hands of the Most Holy Family, to achieve Your distinctive plan for my life.
<br>
Let me now pause for a few moments to think of my sins, faults, and omissions.
<br><br>
<b>Act of Contrition</b><br><br>

O my God! I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all of my sins, because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they have offended Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
<br>
Let us pray: Heavenly Father, in the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask You to release a Poor Soul of one of our loved ones from Purgatory for each of us who have received Your Son in Holy Communion this day, and we ask these souls being released to pray continually that our families and the members and families of The Apostolate do Your will.
