Have I frequently asked the Holy Family for the grace to love God to such a degree that I would be ready to lose everything rather than offend Him through mortal or willful venial sins?<br>
Have I shown my love for God by the way I speak, think and act?<br>
Have I fulfilled my daily duties well with joyful fidelity as the best way of showing my love for God?<br>
Have I often reached outside of my family to evangelize others and to zealously seek to draw them to love God?<br>
Have I tried to transform my daily crosses into moments of growth in grace by accepting them joyfully?<br>

Have I tried to offer my aches and pains patiently and silently, prayerfully begging God's help to endure them, rather than fretting interiorly or complaining to others about them?<br>
Have I given in to inordinate self-love, manifested by self-pity, by neglecting or refusing to fulfill my responsibilities, or by becoming too anxious and preoccupied with self?<br>
Have I tended, out of inordinate pride, to draw undue attention to my successes? Do I, through this same inordinate pride, blame others when things are not successful?<br>
Have I practiced loving God more than myself by telling Him frequently and sincerely that I love Him, by giving Him my best efforts, and by giving Him the credit for any and all good fruits?<br>
Have I sought to consciously humble myself before God and others and to examine whether I am working to serve Him or myself?<br>

<b>St. Joseph Prayer after the Rosary</b><br><br>

Glorious St. Joseph, spouse of the Immaculate Virgin, obtain for me and all the members of my family and loved ones, a confident, sinless, generous, and patient heart, and perfect resignation to the Divine Will. Be our guide, father, and model throughout life, that we may merit a death like yours, in the arms of Jesus and Mary.
<br>
Help us, St. Joseph, in our earthly strife, to fulfill our responsibilities and ever to lead a pure and blameless life.
<br>
Heavenly Father, please ask the Holy Spirit, who resides in the innermost recesses of my soul, to help me to call to mind all of my sins and faults. Help me to detach myself from these faults and sins so that I can be a useful instrument in the hands of the Most Holy Family, to achieve Your distinctive plan for my life.
<br>
Let me now pause for a few moments to think of my sins, faults, and omissions.
<br><br>
<b>Act of Contrition</b><br><br>

O my God! I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee, and I detest all of my sins, because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of hell, but most of all because they have offended Thee, my God, Who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve with the help of Thy grace, to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
<br>
Let us pray: Heavenly Father, in the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask You to release a Poor Soul of one of our loved ones from Purgatory for each of us who have received Your Son in Holy Communion this day, and we ask these souls being released to pray continually that our families and the members and families of The Apostolate do Your will.
